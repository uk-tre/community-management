# Prompts for sessions in quarterly meetings

At the quarterly meetings we ask registrants whether they would like to host a `Project workshop` or `Breakout discussion` on the day.

Those who say yes are sent the following prompts to gather info for their sessions. 
This is sent to them, and organised, via email.

## Project workshops

Project workshops are focused discussions on a specific project, issue or challenge.
They are intended to serve as a collaborative work sessions where the community helps the presenter to move forward in their project. 

### Summary
*Please provide a short paragraph summarising your proposed session, including background and what you hope to cover. 
We'll share this on our website!*

### Required preparation
*Please share anything people should read, know or prepare in advance for the session, or anything they should bring with them*

### Target audience

## Breakout discussions

Breakout discussions are open talks around a topic.
They are open ended, and while we hope actions and collaboration arise from them, there is no specific output expected by the end of the session.
