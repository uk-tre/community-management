# Transparency Policy - UK TRE

# Introduction

We are committed to radical transparency and reject the assumptions and incentives around competition in academia. We believe that a collaborative, not competitive, approach to research is best suited for meeting the world's challenges. 

A core motivation for our transparency is to maximize the trust, as trust is essential for effective collaboration. Transparency also makes it easier for potential partners or contributors to understand where they may fit into our work (“integration points”), and see where we can support each other. We also operate using best practices of open scholarship, to facilitate reproducibility and contribute to the collective knowledge commons. 

We operationalise this commitment by classifying all materials generated by the UKTRE Community Management Working Group (CMWG) as either "Open by Default” or “Closed by Exception," by assessing them against our core duties (see Tables 2a: Duties to Close, and 2b: Duties to Open ). This ensures that inputs, processes, and outputs of the UK TRE CMWG are made immediately public wherever possible, with closure strictly limited to non-negotiable legal and ethical mandates. Unless there is a specific and documented reason, all open materials will be issued with a DOI (ideally as a project collection within [our Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/uktre/members)), with code and documentation released on open license with minimal restrictions for reuse, aligned with the communities we collaborate with. 

We apply these standards of academic-level transparency to all levels of operation of UK TRE CMWG, and recognise that this goes over and above the standard practices of private industry and academic projects in many cases. For the avoidance of doubt, Table 1 describes how and where our transparency standards differ from typical corporate disclosure. 

## UK TRE transparency standards compared to typical corporate disclosure

Note ethical and legal requirements will limit some of the information which it is possible to share openly as described below. See Tables 2a and 2b to see how these are operationalised.

*Table 1: UK TRE transparency standards compared to typical corporate disclosure*

| Component | UK TRE CMWG transparency standard | Typical Corporate Disclosure |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Funding & Bias** | **Conflict and Direction-of-Interest Disclosure:** Full disclosure of all funding sources and amounts to allow current and potential contributors to assess biases and intended direction of travel. | Often aggregates or hides specific contract values, treating them as proprietary commercial information. |
| **Methods & Process** | **Open Methodology (Pre-registration):** Sharing the entire plan (*Project Analysis Plans*, *Data Management Plans*, and *Proposals*) before the work is finalized. | Usually shares the policy but keeps the specific methodology and internal criteria confidential. |
| **Data & Code** | **Reproducibility and Verifiability:** Sharing data (with appropriate privacy safeguards) and applying open-source license to allow any third party to verify the final results. | Usually shares final reports, but rarely the underlying code or the raw data necessary for validation. |
| **Integrity & Failure** | **Combating the "File Drawer" Effect:** Publicly sharing unsuccessful proposals and detailed assessment criteria. | Often hides failures, unsuccessful bids, and internal struggles to maintain a facade of continuous success. |

# Duties which determine transparency

Our decision to **close** materials is based on our commitment to the principles described in Table 2a.

*Table 2a: Duties which determine what materials will remain closed*

| Duty  | What we must protect | Materials categories impacted (see Table 3\) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Duty to Protect Privacy** | * Personal Identifiable Information (PII) / Personal Health Information (PIH); <br>* Individual personal details not openly disclosed by the individual; <br>* Specific compensation. | * Project Data & Code; <br>* Funding/Financial;  <br>*Team/Personnel. |
| **2\. Duty to Protect Security** | * Security vulnerabilities;  <br>* Access Credentials; <br>* Physical/IT Security Protocols. | * Operational; <br>* Project Planning |
| **3\. Duty to Protect Contractual Integrity** | * NDAs; <br>* Partner Trade Secrets; <br>* Active Negotiation/Pricing Details. | * Partner/Client Confidentiality; <br>* Funding/Financial |
| **4\. Duty to Do No Harm (Reputational / Inclusion)** | * Unsubstantiated or potentially harmful opinions; <br>* Defamatory statements; <br>* Non-constructive / exclusionary commentary. | * All Categories (see [Ethical Override Policy](#ethical-override-policy)) |

Our decision to **open** materials is based on a commitment to the principles described in Table 2b.

*Table 2b: Duties which determine what materials should be published openly*

| Duty  | What we must share | Rationale (The Mission-Driven Purpose) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Duty to Enable Reproducibility** | * Project inputs; <br>* Materials to enable process verification; <br>* Project outputs. | * To allow any relevant party to **verify** and **replicate** our research findings and operations\*, ensuring methodological integrity.  |
| **2\. Duty to Facilitate Collaboration** | * Engagement strategy; <br>* Integration points\*\*. | To maximize external engagement by making it easy for contributors to **understand** our work and **integrate** their efforts. |
| **3\. Duty to Uphold Accountability** | * Financial and Governance disclosure. | To allow the community to **audit** our ethics, assess potential **bias**, and confirm responsible use of funds. (E.g., Funding Amounts, Bylaws, Successful/Unsuccessful Proposals). |
| **4\. Duty to Advance the Commons** | * Knowledge contributions and failure reporting. | To actively contribute to the **collective knowledge** and combat the "file drawer problem" by sharing failures, lessons learned, and intermediate results. (E.g., unsuccessful proposals, live datasets, pre-prints). |

\* We position collaborative, community-based processes as a methodology. As such, we aim for our approach to this work to exemplify best practice in research collaboration, and support your efforts to reproduce this method in your own community. 

\*\* We use "integration points” to define any mechanism or standard where an external partner, collaborator, or contributor can connect their work, data, vision, or expertise with our projects. This frames our transparency as providing the mechanism for allowing others to plug into our workflow. By making these integration points transparent, we aim to eliminate some of the typical friction of academic and corporate collaboration, specifically information asymmetry, lack of clear process, and misalignment of incentives.

# Ethical Override policy

If a partner non-compliance issue meets a defined threshold of public harm, our commitment  to partner confidentiality is broken and the information may be moved to the public domain, invoking whistleblower protections.

Since UK TRE is not a governmental organisation, the "whistleblower protection" is less about formal government legal structures and more about internal governance and public defense.

| Action | Description | Function |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Internal Governance** | UK TREs **Consensus, Review and Objection Management** policy (in review) defines the process for independent review and decision-making on whether to publish. This shields the individual community member and makes the disclosure a collective, authorised action. | **Protection for the Individual:** The decision is owned by UK TRE, not just one person, providing professional support. |
| **Legal Invocation** | We primarily invoke the ethical and safety exception of **common law** that protects disclosures made in the *public interest* against harm (e.g., public health, safety, or environmental risk). Where the disclosure relates to research practice, it will likely be covered by EU law. | **Public Defense:** Provides the strongest legal and moral defense against a client lawsuit (e.g., for breach of contract or NDA). |

# Specific examples of open and closed materials

Table 3 classifies a list of materials which may be generated by RCM Cooperative as either "Open by Default” or “Closed by Exception". These classifications are derived by assessing whether the **material must be closed** (meets any of the requirements of Table 2a), or **should be open** (meets any of the requirements of Table 2b). 

We assume Table 3 to be non-exhaustive, and we will add further examples as they are identified or where further clarification is required.
