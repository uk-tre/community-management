# UK TRE Community working and communication spaces

## Jiscmail: Open discussions and annoucements

Our mailing list (UK-TRE-COMM@JISCMAIL.AC.UK) is the main and most important space to watch out for announcements.
All official communications are made here, such as events.

The list is a Public Discussion and everyone (even non subscribers) can send messages, all messages are public and available [here](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=uk-tre-comm).
The use of the list should adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/uk-tre/website/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as well as JISC [Service Policies](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/policyandsecurity/).
The list is currently unmoderated, but we ask that everyone keeps their messages within topic.

We also ask community members to be aware of when they are replying just to the email sender, or when they are replying to the whole mailing list, within a thread.
Please only reply to everyone if it is a message intended for everyone!

We encourage community members unsure about the suitability of their communications to contact a member of the Community Management Working Group, one of its chairs or to write to our inbox at uktrecommunity@gmail.com

## Slack 
We've moved! We are no longer maintaining the previous slack channel within the RSE workspace

[UK TRE Community](https://uktrecommunity.slack.com) is our NEW slack workspace, it is intended as a place to work towards the outputs of specific working groups.
Currently is where the Community Management Working Group coordinates, it is also used by chairs to discuss privately (on the rare ocassions that is needed, like sharing personal details).
There are no specific channels, but these will be created as and if required by emerging interest or working groups.

While everyone is welcome to make an announcement here it is NOT the expected place for them.

## Github: Org, repositories and project tracker

## NEW: proposed announcement list

As we grow and the mailing list has more members it can be too much to keep up with all discussions, and discern between specific discussions and official announcements.
Therefore we are proposing the creation of a new announcement list, only list owners will be able to post messages and these will be restricted to official announcements (chiefly events).
