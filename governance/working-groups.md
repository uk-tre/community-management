# Working groups

## Intro
- What a working group is
- What it isn't (endorsement)

## Process

x. Working group creates a working group charter
x. Charter is reviewed by the CMWG
    - To make sure it is:
        - In line with community principles
        - Is not already being undertaken elsewhere in the community. In this case, we will point the proposers towards this work
x. If not approved, CMWG provides necessary changes back to the WG
x. Once approved, working group charter is opened for discussion on GitHub with wider community for 2 weeks
x. If no key problems arise from community review, WG is formally established and is made live on the UK TRE Community website, with point of contact, summary etc.
    - Think about methods for outreach to community about this
x. Working group carries out work, and reports at a minimum (? in community meetings, quarterly...?) on progress
x. When working group has outputs they would like to share with the community, they submit them to the CMWG
x. CMWG either rejects outputs (with reason provided), accepts them for distribution, or accepts them and formally endorses them
x. Working group chairs confirm dissolution of the working group (using a template)
    - See the [RDA options for closing out a WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/creating-and-managing-rda-groups/creating-or-joining-rda-working-group.html#:~:text=Closing%20out%20a%20Working%20Group)


## Participants
- Clearly defined chair/co-chair
  - More than one?

##Â Commitments
- Making all their outputs open source
- To allow anyone interested to join the group
- To provide updates at community meetings on progress
- Understanding that the outputs won't necessarily be formally endorsed by the UK TRE Community
